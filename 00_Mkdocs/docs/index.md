# Welcome!

Hello!
My name is Adam Frewen, I am a game developer in training!
Welcome to my game programming portfolio.
The following contents consist largely of learnings gained through one semester taking a university Game Programming paper.
Upon graduating at the end of 2016 I aspire to build on these skills through working on projects in my free time and taking part in community game jams!
